# My portfolio (HTML ,CSS, Vanilla-JavaScript edition):
In this project I am planning to consolidate my understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript by building my portfolio page, the page will temporarily be only using vanilla JavaScript, thus, it will have no real server side connection until I learn Node.js,  then I will remake it into a fully-functional portfolio page.
